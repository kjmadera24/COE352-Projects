# COE352-Projects

This repository contains projects for the course COE352: Advanced Scientific Computation. Each project addresses topics in advanced numerical methods and scientific computation

## Projects

### Project 1: Singular Value Decomposition for a Spring-Mass system ###

In this project, the goal was to make an SVD callable function and a user-input function for calculating a spring-mass system using the SVD function.

#### Files:
- `Proj1_pt1.py`
- `Proj1_pt2.py`
- `README.md`

### Project 2: Finite Element Method for the Heat Transfer Problem ###

In this project, the goal was to solve the heat equation using the finite element method with forward and backward Euler time-stepping.
